# Odie's Epic

8\. Odie O'Dool gave the gift of life.

9\. He spread his seed, from day to night.

10\. His farm was vast, with just one crop.

11\. He grew potatoes, year round, non stop. 

12.To veil his skin, from the judgment of the town,

13\. He adorned a hood, shading in the golden brown.

14\. He was a simple farmer, with no reason to be proud.
