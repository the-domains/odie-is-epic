# Odie's Epic

# 1\. Odie O'Dool hath been a fool,2\. Soaked in drool, he dreamt of jewels.3\. There he lay, the tattered tot, 4\. Beat and battered on his cot.4\. Thinking thoughts, his mind had lots, 5\. Connecting dots, others could not.6\. Within his home hangs a broken clock, 7\. Everyday moving just one tic or one toc.8\. Odie was alone, stuck in his home.9\. He lived in a tunnel, which lead to the throne.10\. The tunnel was big, the tunnel was huge,11\. It protected him from the Great Deluge.
